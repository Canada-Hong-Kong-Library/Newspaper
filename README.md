# Canada Hong Kong Library Newspaper Scraping Project #

## What is this project about? ##
This is an ongoing project where library staff periodically scrape and archive articles about select Hong Kong topics from a variety of newspapers. Currently, efforts are focused on archiving topics related to the National Security Law and Hong Kong protests. 

## Sources ##
There are 3 main newspapers this project sources from:
[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong) (For a more neutral stance on topics regarding Hong Kong)
[Hong Kong Free Press](https://hongkongfp.com/) (Pro-Hong Kong Publication)
[China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/59b8d010a3108c54ed7dfc30) (Pro-China Publication)

## Process and Code ##
Every week, a staff member will run a simple scraping code written in Python on Google Colab and the newest article's title, date, and url will be added to the library's main list. The code is available below, and can only be accessed by logging in through the library's internal gmail account.

## List of articles ##

While we are unable to scrape the backlog of SCMP articles, we have gathered previous article titles from HKFP and China Daily. The SCMP data will therefore be of limited numbers compared to HKFP and China Daily.
